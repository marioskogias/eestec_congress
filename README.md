eestec_congress
===============
This is a simple django application used during eestec congress 2014 in Athens.

Its purpose is to keep track of the people missing during the presentations and 
every other activity of the congress.

It is very simple in use. Every participant had a QR code in his/her badge and 
and with a mobile app scanning the QR we could keep track of the missing participants.

The app makes use of a few important Django assets:

1. Django ORM

2. Django admin panel and custom actions on the admin panel

3. Django templates

All the UI was created with Django templates and bootstrap framework
